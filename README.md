# **News Flutter Application**

## **Overview**

The **News Flutter Application** is a dynamic mobile app built using Flutter, which leverages the **NewsAPI** to fetch and display news articles across various categories, including **Business**, **Sports**, and **Science**. The application demonstrates efficient handling of API endpoints, real-time data fetching, and user-friendly design principles.

### **Key Features**
- **Category-Based News:** Fetch and display news articles for Business, Sports, and Science categories. Each category corresponds to a specific API endpoint.
- **Light and Dark Mode Support:** Users can seamlessly switch between light and dark themes to suit their preferences.
- **Responsive UI:** Designed to provide a smooth experience on devices of all sizes.
- **Efficient API Integration:** Demonstrates proficiency in handling HTTP requests, parsing JSON responses, and error management.

## **Technical Highlights**
- **API Integration:** Utilized the **NewsAPI** to retrieve real-time news data.
- **State Management:** Implemented effective state management using Flutterâ€™s stateful widgets and/or other state management techniques (e.g., BLoC/Provider).
- **Navigation:** Smooth navigation between screens using Flutter's built-in navigation features.
- **Dark/Light Themes:** Persistent theme selection stored locally using a caching mechanism.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error-handling mechanisms ensure a robust user experience even during network issues.
